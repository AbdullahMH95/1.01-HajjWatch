## A project description:

Hajj Watch helps pilgrims to get better experience in doing Hajj activity, starting with translation speech to Arabic language for non Arabic speaker, get best direction to specific location like Kabbah, Jammarat and campaign, find in the map family member or friends, also train’s boarding by QR code, also the government and the campaign can notify pilgrims with any announcement by send notification to the watch, finally Hajj Watch has section for emergence numbers.

In the future we have ideas that can be added to Hajj Watch, it would make Hajj experience better, like: body health tracker, crowed notification and suggested pray (Dowa’a) in specific location.

## “Team members”
  Muath Alkhulayfi,

  Abdullah Almahri
  
## “It's built with”
  Android Studio / Java / XML
  
  ## Inspiration
Pilgrims in many places could lose one of his/her friends or family member, or miss way to get back to campaign, also the languages is one of the most common problem so the pilgrims can't ask about anything, also if any problem happens not easy to find emergency numbers.
so we Decide To Start "Hajj Watch".

## What it does
Hajj Watch has many features as:
1- Navigate pilgrims with best way to list of important places.
2- notify pilgrims if there is any problem or crowded in the way.
3- translate pilgrims speech to Arabic lang in realtime.
4- Train boarding one of Hajj Watch feature

## How we built it
we are building the project in Android Studio because  it's compatible with Android wear OS and it's open source, so in the feature we can build our own watch.

## Challenges we ran into
we ran into many Challenges in which platform should we develop the Project the after days of searching we have chose Android wear OS as mention above and many more.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
we are proud of developing the first prototype that can explain full features of The "Hajj Watch".

## What we learned
we have learned how to deal with Google Cloud Speech Recognition and Translation, also Google Map Platform.

## What's next for A-086 Hajj Watch
We think we will complete our project and we will do more work on the business side so the pilgrims can have really good experience in the Hajj.
